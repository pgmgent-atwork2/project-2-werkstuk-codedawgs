# Boudewijn Seapark Filter application
This project was made for Boudewijn Seapark. We have a login and register page for the employees where they can create their account and login. The employees can complete general, daily, weekly and monthly tasks, and see a progressbar per department in an interval (for example: Daily tasks - Dolphins). The admin has the authority to create, read, update and delete tasks, users and measurement definitions. As an employee, you can add a new analysis, where you have the option to choose between morning and afternoon and where they can filter on department. If a certain measurement does not meet the quota of the measurement definitions, everyone will receive a notification about that measurement (for example: front pool: 1pH for pH is 6.20pH too low).
